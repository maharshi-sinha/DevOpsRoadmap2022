Hi, I am Rohit.

I am following this DevOps roadmap to become a DevOps engineer.

## Prerequisites

For the prerequisites I am following [Linux & Docker Fundamentals - complete hands-on workshop by KubeSimplify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUu1E_YKGTw&list=PLPcNVxEzHjj2zAiYyRNeruDtCh2gu154i&index=2&t=4847s). It's very comprehensive so I am learning from this instead of the [Introduction of Linux](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux) from EdX.
