Update:
A lot happened in the past months.
My college reopened, I started learning iOS development, improved my social life a bit.
I failed to keep up with the roadmap as I expected, I don't know why it happened, time passed so fast but I am here again, more determined this time.
I am completeing the AWS Cloud Practitioner Course by freecodecamp, Learning Basics of Kubernetes and about to dive deep in the field.
I will try hard to keep up this time without fail.
Rewatched the roadmap video, things became more clear.
I am also attending Kubecon(virtually), really excited for that.
I plan to learn more about docker security and dockerFile best practices.
Will update soon.
